    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data. It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the dataset and representing each sentence as a vector of word counts. We first need the vocabulary, which we will build from both the full sentences and the compressed sentences. Similar to the first lab, the vocabulary will be a list of unique words from the dataset."

    "We evaluated the TF-IDF search using the query \"climate change protest\". The top results mostly included climate-related articles, showing TF-IDF’s strength in emphasizing rare and informative words. Results such as policy announcements and UN climate conferences were expected and relevant, with strong keyword overlap.\n",
    "However, some results were unexpected — such as song lyrics or general climate science without any connection to protest or activism. These failures stem from TF-IDF’s inability to understand context, semantics, and intent. It relies solely on word overlap and frequency, which can be misleading when generic words like “change” dominate.\n",
    "Overall, TF-IDF performed better than raw BoW by reducing noise and prioritizing meaningful terms. Yet, it still fails in nuanced cases, and could be improved further by incorporating word embeddings, query expansion, or topic modeling."

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",

    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
