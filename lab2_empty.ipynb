    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data. It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the dataset and representing each sentence as a vector of word counts.

The top results mostly included climate-related articles, showing TF-IDF’s strength in emphasizing rare and informative words. Results such as policy announcements and UN climate conferences were expected and relevant, with strong keyword overlap.\n",
    "However, some results were unexpected — such as song lyrics or general climate science without any connection to protest or activism. These failures stem from TF-IDF’s inability to understand context, semantics, and intent. It relies solely on word overlap and frequency, which can be misleading when generic words like “change” dominate.\n",

    "#Two words are closer if they: Frequently Appear in Similar Contexts, Belong to the Same Semantic Category, Are Antonyms but Co-occur Often. They belong to the same semantic or emotional category (joy, happy, smile...), even antonyms such as love and hate can be considered close if they appear in similar environments.\n",

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."

Pre-trained embeddings performed worst at Recall@1 but still delivered strong Recall@10, indicating that they can retrieve semantically similar sentences, even if they're not ranked at the top. This highlights the trade-off between exact matching and semantic generalization in information retrieval."
