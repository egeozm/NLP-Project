    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data. It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the dataset and representing each sentence as a vector of word counts. We first need the vocabulary, which we will build from both the full sentences and the compressed sentences. Similar to the first lab, the vocabulary will be a list of unique words from the dataset."

As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
